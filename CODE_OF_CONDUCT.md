# Code of Conduct

This goes without saying, but please do not use Bellmer for anything that violates Roblox's [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use) or [Community Standards](https://about.roblox.com/community-standards). You *know* why we have to put this disclaimer here. Contributors who are found to be using Bellmer to intentionally violate Roblox's Terms of Use or Community Standards will be blocked from the repository.

Aside from that, be respectful towards other contributors and try to understand each other when you run into disagreements. This shouldn't need to be elaborated on given how small the pool of contributors are currently, but if the community surrounding the project significantly expands, expect this to be updated with a more comprehensive code of conduct.
