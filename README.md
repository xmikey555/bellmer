Bellmer is a free & open source engine for powering multi-genre roleplay experiences on Roblox.

# Documentation
coming soon...

# Installation
1. Grab an .rbxl file from the [Releases](https://github.com/xmikey555/bellmer/releases) page.
2. Do the usual setup for a Roblox place file
3. **THIS IS IMPORTANT:** Grab yourself a copy of loleris' [ProfileStore](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/profilestore-save-your-player-data-easy-datastore-module/3190543) and place the module into ServerScriptService. The place will *not* work without it, and you'll be warned in the output window if you forgot to install it. (The reason this isn't included in the repository is because putting dependencies *inside* of the source is bad practice.) 
4. Enjoy

# Contribution Guidelines
Thank you for contributing! (or at least thinking about it.) Here's some guidelines:
- Any contributions to the main repository should be something useful for *all* downstream forks.
- The main repository currently does not accept 3D assets (models, meshes) aside from the bundled example assets.
- Do not submit low-effort AI-generated pull requests or issues. We will be very disappointed in you if you do this.
  - (This does not fully exclude the usage of AI for coding, just make sure you're using it as a tool and not a crutch)
